Sickbeard Episode Cleaner
==

A post processing script for Sickbeard that allows you to set the number of episodes of a show that you would like to keep. Useful for shows that air daily.

The script sorts the episodes you have for a show by the season and episode number, and then deletes the oldest episodes past the threshold you set.

Configuration

Configuration is pretty straight forward as this sample config file shows. The keys under shows are the tvdb id's for the shows you want to clean.

There is a sample config included. Just move it to config.json.
``` mv sickbeard-episode-cleaner/config.json.sample sickbeard-episode-cleaner/config.json ```

```json
{
    "server": {
    	"hostname": "",
		"port": 8081,
		"web_root": "",
		"api_key": ""
	},
	"shows": {
        // The Colbert Report
		"79274": {					// tvdb id
			"keep_episodes": 10		// number of episodes to keep
		},
        // The Daily Show
